I removed the static stuff in the linker settings (was causing me issues).
Sorry if it's a burden for you, maybe we can talk about it and see if 
there's a better way.

I commented out (with 3 ///) the parts of the programs that don't have
functionality just yet so we can at least run the prog while we do things.

About searching through containers (like drawing enemies and such), you 
might want to apply a check before searching (ie. container isn't empty) 
first. Specifically in CollisionManager's update function.

I also changed the way the Game header works, specifically gameRun() funct.
It just seems like it's taking over the work of main(). Rather than that, 
I'm thinking the class should be controlling the flow of the game, like
what's the current game condition(running, lost, won), levels and so on.
